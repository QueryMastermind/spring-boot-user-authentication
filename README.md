# 🔗 CRUD REST API Project – Spring Boot

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **RESTful API-based CRUD application** developed using **Spring Boot**. The main focus of this project is **API handling**, where I designed and implemented multiple endpoints to perform **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** operations.

All APIs were tested and validated using **Postman**, following proper HTTP methods and response structures.

## 🚀 Features

* Create new records using REST APIs
* Fetch single and multiple records
* Update existing records
* Delete records
* Proper use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* JSON-based request and response handling
* Exception handling for invalid requests

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Java
* Spring Boot
* Spring Web (REST APIs)
* Spring Data JPA
* Hibernate
* MySQL
* Maven
* Postman (API testing)

## ⚙️ API Flow (How It Works)

1. Client sends HTTP request from Postman
2. Controller layer handles the API request
3. Service layer processes business logic
4. Repository layer interacts with database
5. Response is sent back in JSON format

## 🧪 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint         | Description      |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| POST   | /api/create      | Create new data  |
| GET    | /api/all         | Fetch all data   |
| GET    | /api/{id}        | Fetch data by ID |
| PUT    | /api/update/{id} | Update data      |
| DELETE | /api/delete/{id} | Delete data      |
